by [Amelia Hetrick](https://github.com/ameliahetrick) and [James Edwards](https://github.com/shortsVanGogh)

A Python multilayer perceptron neural network classifier that trains on 2016 primary debate speeches then predicts the political party of a candidate based on their general debate speeches.

Run political.py with command line inputs:
```
[program] [train in] [train labels in] [test in] [test labels in] [predicted labels out]

python3 political.py primary_stemmed.csv primaryClassified.txt general_stemmed.csv generalClassified.txt out.txt
