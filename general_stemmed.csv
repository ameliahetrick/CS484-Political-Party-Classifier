"94","Clinton","well I think donald wa about to say he s go to solv it by repeal it and get rid of the afford care act and I m go to fix it becaus I agre with you premium have gotten too high copay deduct prescript drug cost and I ve laid out a seri of action that we can take to tri to get those cost down but here s what I don t want peopl to forget when we re talk about rein in the cost which ha to be the highest prioriti of the next presid when the afford care act pass it wasn t just that 20 million got insur who didn t have it befor but that in and of itself wa a good thing I meet these peopl all the time and they tell me what a differ have that insur meant to them and their famili but everybodi els the 170 million of us who get health insur through our employe got big benefit number one insur compani can t deni you coverag becaus of a pre-exist condit number two no lifetim limit which is a big deal if you have seriou health problem number three women can t be charg more than men for our health insur which is the way it use to be befor the afford care act number four if you re under 26 and your parent have a polici you can be on that polici until the age of 26 someth that didn t happen befor So I want veri much to save what work and is good about the afford care act but we ve got to get cost down We ve got to provid addit help to small busi so that they can afford to provid health insur but if we repeal it as donald ha propos and start over again all of those benefit I just mention are lost to everybodi not just peopl who get their health insur on the exchang and then we would have to start all over again right now we are at 90 percent health insur coverag that s the highest we ve ever been in our countri","10/9/16"
"96","Clinton","So I want us to get to 100 percent but get cost down and keep qualiti up","10/9/16"
"98","Trump","It is such a great question and it s mayb the question I get almost more than anyth els outsid of defens obamacar is a disast you know it We all know it It s go up at number that nobodi s ever seen worldwid nobodi s ever seen number like thi for health care It s onli get wors In 17 it implod by itself their method of fix it is to go back and ask congress for more money more and more money We have right now almost 20 trillion in debt obamacar will never work It s veri bad veri bad health insur far too expens and not onli expens for the person that ha it unbeliev expens for our countri It s go to be one of the biggest line item veri shortli We have to repeal it and replac it with someth absolut much less expens and someth that work where your plan can actual be tailor We have to get rid of the line around the state artifici line where we stop insur compani from come in and compet becaus they want -- and presid obama and whoever wa work on it -- they want to leav those line becaus that give the insur compani essenti monopoli We want competit you will have the finest health care plan there is she want to go to a single-pay plan which would be a disast somewhat similar to canada and if you haven t notic the canadian when they need a big oper when someth happen they come into the unit state in mani case becaus their system is so slow It s catastroph in certain way but she want to go to singl payer which mean the govern basic rule everyth hillari clinton ha been after thi for year obamacar wa the first step obamacar is a total disast and not onli are your rate go up by number that nobodi s ever believ but your deduct are go up so that unless you get hit by a truck you re never go to be abl to use it","10/9/16"
"100","Trump","It is a disastr plan and it ha to be repeal and replac","10/9/16"
"102","Clinton","No I mean he clarifi what he meant and it s veri clear look we are in a situat in our countri where if we were to start all over again we might come up with a differ system but we have an employer-bas system that s where the vast major of peopl get their health care and the afford care act wa meant to tri to fill the gap between peopl who were too poor and couldn t put togeth ani resourc to afford health care name peopl on medicaid obvious medicar which is a single-pay system which take care of our elderli and doe a great job do it by the way and then all of the peopl who were employ but peopl who were work but didn t have the money to afford insur and didn t have anybodi an employ or anybodi els to help them that wa the slot that the obamacar approach wa to take and like I say 20 million peopl now have health insur So if we just rip it up and throw it away what donald s not tell you is we just turn it back to the insur compani the way it use to be and that mean the insur compani","10/9/16"
"104","Clinton","get to do pretti much whatev they want includ say look I m sorri you ve got diabet you had cancer your child ha asthma","10/9/16"
"106","Clinton","you may not be abl to have insur becaus you can t afford it So let s fix what s broken about it but let s not throw it away and give it all back to the insur compani and the drug compani that s not go to work","10/9/16"
"108","Trump","well I just want -- just one thing first of all hillari everyth s broken about it everyth number two berni sander said that hillari clinton ha veri bad judgment thi is a perfect exampl of it tri to save obamacar which is a disast","10/9/16"

"114","Trump","well I ll tell you what it mean you re go to have plan that are so good becaus we re go to have so much competit in the insur industri onc we break out -- onc we break out the line and allow the competit to come","10/9/16"
"116","Trump","presid obama -- anderson excus me presid obama by keep those line the boundari line around each state it wa almost gone until just veri toward the end of the passag of obamacar which by the way wa a fraud you know that becaus jonathan gruber the architect of obamacar wa said -- he said it wa a great lie it wa a big lie presid obama said you keep your doctor you keep your plan the whole thing wa a fraud and it doesn t work but when we get rid of those line you will have competit and we will be abl to keep pre-exist we ll also be abl to help peopl that can t get -- don t have money becaus we are go to have peopl protect and republican feel thi way believ it or not and strongli thi way We re go to block grant into the state We re go to block grant into medicaid into the state","10/9/16"
