"21","Sanders","well to put that in a context judi I think we have to understand that in the last 30 year in thi countri there ha been a massiv transfer of wealth go from the hand of work famili into the top one-tenth of 1 whose percentag of wealth ha doubl In other word the veri rich are get richer almost everybodi is go -- get poorer what I believ is the unit state in fact should join the rest of the industri world and guarante healthcar to all peopl our medicar for all single-pay propos will save the averag middl class famili 5 000 a year I do believ that in the year 2016 we have to look in term of public educ as colleg as part of public educ make public colleg and univers tuition free I believ that when real unemploy is close to 10 and when our infrastructur our road our bridg our water system flint michigan come to mind our wast water plant our rail our airport in mani place are disintegr yeah we can creat 13 million job by rebuild our infrastructur at a cost of a trillion dollar","2/11/16","Democratic","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111520"
"23","Sanders","Of cours there will be a limit but when today you have massiv level of incom and wealth inequ when the middl class is disappear you have the highest rate of child poverti of almost ani major countri on earth ye in my view the govern of a democrat societi ha a moral respons to play a vital role in make sure all of our peopl have a decent standard of live","2/11/16","Democratic","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111520"
"24","Clinton","judi I think that the best analysi that I ve seen base on senat sander plan is that it would probabl increas the size of the feder govern by about 40 but what is most concern to me is that in look at the plan -- let s take healthcar for exampl last week in a cnn town hall the senat told a question that the question would spend about 500 dollar in tax to get about 5 000 dollar in healthcar everi progress economist who ha analyz that say that the number don t add up and that s a promis that cannot be kept and it s realli import now that we are get into the rest of the countri that both of us are held to account for explain what we are propos becaus especi with healthcar thi is not about math thi is about peopl s live and we should level with the american peopl about what we can do to make sure they get qualiti afford healthcar","2/11/16","Democratic","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111520"

"27","Clinton","I can onli say that we both share the goal of univers health care coverag you know befor it wa call obamacar it wa call hillarycar and I took on the drug compani and I took on the insur compani to tri to get us univers health care coverag","2/11/16","Democratic","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111520"
